Hello,

The src and srcPDF folders contain roughly the same content. The only difference between the two is that the gamefiles within the src folder
are of the .java file type while the game files within the srcPDF folder are of the .pdf type.

The res folder contains the games graphics (sprites, tiles, music, and UI) as well as the different .txt files which contain the 
map information. The vscode folder has nothing of significance. You may also notice the PONG folder. This contains another one 
of my projects, a clone of the classic game PONG. I included it because it was last years final project and it does a good job 
showcasing my development over the past year.

Anyways, thank you for taking the time to delve into the project files. I hope that whoever ends up reviewing all these files 
and playing my games enjoys doing so. They were fun to develop and I'm feeling quite lucky to be able to share them. 

My thanks,

Will Otterbein
