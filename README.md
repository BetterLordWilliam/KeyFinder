# General Info

KeyFinder was a game that I created with Java back during the end of 2022 and during the start of 2023. 
The project took approximately 3 months to fully complete due to a busy school schedule, but in March of 2023 I made the last official changes. 

Towards the end of the project, while conversing with my computer programming 12 intructor, he suggested that I submit this project not only as a final project for his course, 
but also to the Distric Authority for the chance of winning $1250. After some anxious waiting, I heard back from the Distric Authority with good news. 
KeyFinder and it's documentation had secured me the schlarship!

The creation of this game was an exercise in object-oriented design as well as a test of my knowledge of programming concepts such as recursion.
