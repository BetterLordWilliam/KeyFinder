## General Info

### About the Project

KeyFinder was a game that I created with Java back during the end of 2022 and during the start of 2023. The project took approximately 3 months to fully complete due to a busy school schedule, but in March of 2023 I made the last official changes.

Towards the end of the project, while conversing with my Computer Programming 12 instructor, he suggested that I submit this project not only as a final project for his course, but also to the District Authority for the chance of winning $1250. After some anxious waiting, I heard back from the District Authority with good news. KeyFinder and its documentation had secured me the scholarship!

The creation of this game was an exercise in object-oriented design as well as a test of my knowledge of programming concepts such as recursion.

### Requirements

Java is required to be able to run this project. Download java from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

### How to Run

This is very easy! So long as you have Java installed, simply download this folder and run the [provided jar](./2DJavaGame%20SUBMISSION-SC.jar) file give the name '2DJavaGame SUBMISSION-SC.jar'

Enjoy!

### What to do

In the KeyFinder game you are the key finder, a character who must collect keys to open locked doors and access the final purple chest of each level. There are four levels in total each containing three to four different keys. 

Key example:
![bkey](./res/objects/B_Key.png)![rkey](./res/objects/R_Key.png)![ykey](./res/objects/Y_Key.png)

Once you reach the final level and unlock the last chest ![alt text](./res/objects/ChestClosed.png),

you will have successfully completed the game. Congratulations! From here you are free to play again or quit the game by pressing the 'esc' key.

If you want more information, feel free to read the documentation that I wrote for this game [here](./KeyFinder%20Design%20Document.pdf).
